## Overview
        
        This is a simple social proof section. We've used flexbox to make it responsive. We've also used a few media queries to make it responsive for mobile devices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

    We've been working on accessibility so this code is a bit different from the original. We've added a few aria attributes and a few roles to make the site more accessible.
```html
    <div role="presentation" class="rating-section-part-one">
```

### Continued development
    We'll keep building cool websites

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13637106/what-are-the-best-width-ranges-for-media-queries) -  This helped me for media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
